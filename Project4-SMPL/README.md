This project is to mesh a model with SMPL model based on the motion capture data from [CMU MoCap](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/) dataset.

A lightweight implmentation can be found on [github](https://github.com/CalciferZh/SMPL-AMC-Imitator), and I outline a Chinese notation for the objects in main codes. Remark: You can download the pdf version here [Appendix.pdf](./Appendix.pdf).
